# Interactive Plot

```{python}
interactive_plots = plot_solution_interactive(base_solution)
interactive_plots.embed(max_states=20, max_opts=20)
```

# Tasks

Use the sliders in the interactive plot to change the value of the parameters $v$ and $D$.
Observe the effect on the shape of the concentration curve.
Answer the following questions:

- How can you explain the increase of the concentration over time?
- How does a larger value of $v$ influence the concentration curve?
- How does a larger value of $D$ influence the concentration curve?
- What do the parameters $v$ and $D$ represent? Which process do they correspond to, respectively?

# Background: Breakthrough Curves

The interactive plot above shows a breakthrough curve, that is, a concentration curve measured over time, showing the “breakthrough” of a chemical.
You can imagine that it was measured with the sensor shown in the following sketch, that illustrates a contaminant plume leaking into groundwater.
^[Note that both the sketch and the model used to compute the breakthrough curve are a very simplified representation of contaminant transport.]
